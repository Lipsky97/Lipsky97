### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working as .NET Developer
- ðŸ”­ When applying for my first developer job, my main language was Python, but thanks to my colleagues at work and great mentoring I've learned .Net, TypeScript, JS, and many more.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything
- âš¡ Fun fact: One of the worldâ€™s best-known rabbits is the Warner Bros cartoon character, Bugs Bunny â€” whoâ€™s often seen munching on a carrot! In fact, carrots arenâ€™t a natural part of a rabbitâ€™s diet and can give bunnies an upset stomach if they eat too many.
